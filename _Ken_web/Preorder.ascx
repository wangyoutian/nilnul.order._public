	<li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reachability" title="Reachability">reachability</a> relationship in any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph" title="Directed graph">directed graph</a> (possibly containing cycles) gives rise to a preorder, where <i>x</i> ≤ <i>y</i> in the preorder if and only if there is a path from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i> in the directed graph. Conversely, every preorder is the reachability relationship of a directed graph (for instance, the graph that has an edge from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i> for every pair (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) with <i>x</i> ≤ <i>y</i>). However, many different graphs may have the same reachability preorder as each other. In the same way, reachability of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph" title="Directed acyclic graph">directed acyclic graphs</a>, directed graphs with no cycles, gives rise to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set" title="Partially ordered set">partially ordered sets</a> 
		(preorders satisfying an additional anti-symmetry property).</li>
